# Task Manager

## Description
This is a simple web-based Task Manager application that allows users to manage tasks with three statuses: To-Do, In-Progress, and Closed. Users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, change their status, filter tasks by status, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a task name.
- Edit task names.
- Change task status between To-Do, In-Progress, and Closed.
- Filter tasks by status or view all tasks.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Clear all tasks.
- Tasks are saved in localStorage for persistence across browser sessions.

2. Enter a task name in the input field and click the save icon to add a new task.
3. Use the dropdown next to each task to change its status.
